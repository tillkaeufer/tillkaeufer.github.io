My name is Till KÃ¤ufer and I am a PhD student in Astronomy at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), a member of the St&nbsp;Andrews [Centre for Exoplanet Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/exoplanets/), and an Early Stage Researcher in the [CHAMELEON network](https://chameleon.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/).
As part of the CHAMELEON network my research deals with protoplanetary disks. I develop techniques based on Machine Learning to link astronomical observations to theoretical models.
