My name is Till KÃ¤ufer and I am a PhD student in Astronomy and an Early Stage Researcher in the [CHAMELEON network](https://chameleon.iwf.oeaw.ac.at/).
I started my PhD at the [Centre for Exoplanet Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/exoplanets/) of the [University of St&nbsp;Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/).
I did an one-year secondment at [SRON](https://www.sron.nl/) associated with the [Kapteyn Astronomical Institute](https://www.rug.nl/research/kapteyn/) in Groningen. 
Currently, I am finishing my PhD at the [IWF](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/iwf) in Graz, Austria.  
As part of the CHAMELEON network my research deals with protoplanetary disks. I develop techniques based on Machine Learning to link astronomical observations to theoretical models.
