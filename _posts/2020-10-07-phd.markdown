## PhD project

Spectral features emitted by molecules situated in the upper layers of protoplanetary
disks, as for example observable in the near to mid infrared with VLT and JWST, in
principle allow us to determine the temperature and chemical composition of the gas in
the planet forming regions of the disks within ~10 au, which has important implications
for planet formation. My project combines our expertise in modelling molecular
emission bands from protoplanetary disks (Woitke et al. 2016, A&A 586, 103) with new
machine learning techniques developed in the exoplanet community. Our ambitious aim
is to train AI systems based on the spectra predicted by our complex disk models, where
we put in all the relevant astrochemistry, radiative transfer and heating/cooling physics.
Those AI systems can then quickly predict the emergent line emission spectra as
function of the physical input parameters like element abundances, temperature profile,
UV irradiation, dust/gas ratio, etc., which will allow us to thoroughly fit and analyse
observational data and determine the physical disk parameters and their observational
uncertainties including their error bars.
